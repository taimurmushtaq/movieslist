## Architecture

"Model View Controller" approach is used in development of this project

### Model
Model objects encapsulate the data specific to an application and define the logic and computation that manipulate and process that data.

### View
A view is an object in an application that users can see. A view knows how to draw itself and can respond to user actions. A major purpose of view is to display data from the application’s model objects and to enable the editing of that data

### Controller
A controller acts as an intermediary between one or more of an application’s view and one or more of its model. Controller are thus a conduit through which view objects learn about changes in model objects and vice versa. Controller can also perform setup and coordinating tasks for an application and manage the life cycles of other objects.
